% RTL-SDR(rx) FM Mono Non Coherent Discriminator Demodulator MATLAB Script
% - This script can be used to non-coherently demodulate an FM signal. The
%   DSP operations carried out here are identical to those in the
%   "rtlsdr_rx_fm_mono_bbox.slx" Simulink model
% - When the script runs, two Spectrum Analyzers will appear. 'Spectrum
%   Analyzer Modulated' shows the signal received by the RTL-SDR, and
%   'Spectrum Analyzer Demodulated' shows the demodulated information
%   signal
% - You may change the RTL-SDR tuner frequency by modifying the value set
%	in "rtlsdr_freq", the tuner gain by modifying "rtlsdr_gain", and the
%   region of the de-emphasis filter by modifying "deemph_region"
% - Set the simulation run time by modifying "sim_time". Any value you
%   enter represents the number of seconds the script will loop for
% - NOTE: to end simulation early, use |Ctrl| + |C|

% - To view file information without running the code, type:
%       mfileinfo rtlsdr_fm_discrim_demod_matlab
%   into the MATLAB comman window
